Hbh service

Description : Developed a service app for service engineers to efficiently manage and provide support
for electronic products. The app allows engineers to view a list of service requests based on their
location, ensuring that only issues nearby are displayed. By utilizing the device’s GPS, the app retrieves
the engineer’s real-time location and filters service tickets accordingly. The app also enables engineers
to track job status, access customer histories, and update service progress. Kotlin and Retrofit are used
for seamless API communication, ensuring real-time updates and synchronization.

Technologies Used : Kotlin, MVVM, Room Database, LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Android SDK.
